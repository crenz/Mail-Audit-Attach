Revision history for Perl extension Mail::Audit::Attach.

0.94  Sun Jun 05 23:00:00 2005
    - Updated distribution to more modern format.
    - Added POD tests.

0.93  Sat Apr 14 00:30:00 2003
    - Mail::Audit->save died when passed an empty location. Fixed.
      location is now optional.
    - Now uses File::Spec for more portability
    - Introduced Mail::Audit::error (used by save)
    - Localized $_ where used

0.92  Sat Feb  8 13:00:00 2003
	- Now relies on MIME::Head to recognize attachments.
	  "Never try to be too clever."
	- No more warnings.

0.91  Thu Feb  6 22:30:00 2003
        - Now recognizes attachments with Content-Disposition inline,
          but a given filename. This became necessary because Netscape
   	  Communicator and other clients send their attachments that way.

	  Thanks to Jeff Engelhardt and Vladimir Parkhaev for bringing
          this to my attention.
